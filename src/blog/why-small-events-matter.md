**It’s all in the detail**

The bigger the event, the more compromising you’re doing, both from a budget and resources point of view. Smaller events allow you to put greater emphasis on the details and ensure no stone is left unturned in creating an event that speaks true to your brand. You could save significant costs by way of less catering, a smaller venue, less staffing requirements etc, but you could also utilise the same, or a slightly smaller, budget to go the extra mile on a smaller event and tick off that wishlist. Narrowing the focus is what a smaller event can allow for and this focus will certainly be felt by those attending. 

 

**Increased engagement and interaction**

Hosting a smaller event can create a more intimate atmosphere, which can lead to increased engagement and interaction among attendees. With fewer people in attendance, it's easier for guests to connect with each other and with the event itself. This is because smaller events often feel less formal and more relaxed, allowing guests to feel more comfortable and open to meeting new people.

 

For example, at a workshop or seminar, attendees may be looking for a more focused experience, and a smaller event can provide that. With fewer distractions, attendees can fully engage with the content and connect with other like-minded individuals who share their interests or goals. This can lead to more meaningful conversations and connections, which can have a long-lasting impact beyond the event itself.

 

**Create hype and build that brand!n** 

The less tickets you need to sell, the higher the chance of selling your event out, and selling it out in record time too. This in itself creates brand awareness and hype, turning your event into the ‘*must go to*’ event on the calendar. Hosting this event in a smaller venue too will create the illusion of a big audience and help generate that intimate atmosphere we touched on above. With each sold out event, the word spreads further and you’re on your way to garnering that loyal following, something all successful brands are good at creating! 

 

While hosting a smaller event may seem easier and less time consuming, it's important to remember that the devil is in the detail. Effective event planning is key to hosting a success event, regardless of the size. One of the key facets of events is ticketing and having a good partner is essential in reducing your time and allowing you to focus on the other important items. This is where Yopas into play.
