Despite the current proliferation of 3D [movies](https://newatlas.com/avatar-movie-james-cameron-technology/13628/?itm_source=newatlas&itm_medium=article-body), [cameras](https://newatlas.com/jvc-announces-3d-hd-consumer-camcorder/17678/?itm_source=newatlas&itm_medium=article-body), [televisions](https://newatlas.com/pic3d-glasses-free-3d/19080/?itm_source=newatlas&itm_medium=article-body) and [mobile devices](https://newatlas.com/gadmei-p83-3d-pmp/19061/?itm_source=newatlas&itm_medium=article-body), there are those of us who still question whether 3D is here to stay, or if it's just a marketing gimmick that will eventually peter out.
